# Philter - Filtering Philadelphia

An aggregator for Philadelphia specific information.
Includes SEPTA info, traffic, weather, r/Philadelphia, and news from Twitter feeds.

**Written in Java with Swing.**

## Requirements

Philter requires Gson and Twitter4J to run.

Tested with:

Gson 2.2.2 - http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/

Twitter4J 3.0.3 - http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html#download

## API Keys

In addition to libraries, you will also need API keys from the following services:

Twitter - https://dev.twitter.com/

MapQuest - http://developer.mapquest.com/

Weather Underground - http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/

**Note**: This app will work perfectly fine with free accounts. You must keep in mind that these accounts are limited, however. Twitter only allows for 15 calls every 15 minutes while Weather Underground only allows for 10 calls every minute. This is fine for individual use but can cause problems if keys are shared among users.
